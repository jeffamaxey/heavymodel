# Installation

As `heavymodel` is currently in closed beta, no installation instructions are provided here.

Once it is released, it will be available for download from github.

If you wish to deploy sitewide, copy the heavymodel\ folder to a directory on your module search path e.g. `C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\` or similar.
